# Condor Storage

Condor Storage is a web app that allows the users to store their files in IPFS and creating a smart contract that saves in the Ethereum blockchain the metadata of the uploaded file and bounds it to a wallet through a smart contract created with Solidity.

## Setup

As this is development in progress app, you must install Truffle and Ganache in your computer.

- You must run Ganache
- You must have a browser wallet with ETH
- Just run "yarn" 
- Then "truffle migrate --reset --config truffle-config.cjs"
- And finally "yarn dev"

This way you will be able to instsall dependencies, migrate the smart contracts and run the app.

Happy File uploading :)
